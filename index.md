## About Me

---
Hello, I'm Audrey. Welcome to my website!

I'm a final-year undergraduate student at Wellesley College studying Data Science with a concentration in Linguistics. My work sits at the intersection of language, technology, and society, where I use computational tools to analyze multilingual communication, digital discourse, and user behavior. I have conducted research across disciplines, including mapping the book trade in Early Modern London with the MIT Digital Humanities Lab to studying social media algorithm awareness at CMU. My current honors thesis, supported by the Levitt Fellowship, explores identity negotiation through Cantonese-English social media engagement.
